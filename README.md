# Anilog

Anilog is an application that allows you to see various information about anime. The application was developed (in Swift) for the purpose of training me and not for profit. For the design I was inspired by the application [NineAnimator](https://github.com/SuperMarcus/NineAnimator)

## Features

- See Anime (today, schedule, top, tendance)
- See Anime informations (title, synopsis, casting, etc)
- Search Anime
- Switch Light/Dark mode in settings

## Third-Party

To display various Animes and their informations, I use two API

- [Jikan - Unofficial MyAnimeList.net PHP API](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan)
- [AniList Api](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs)

## Usage

Just clone the repo and open it with XCode

Install the dependencies (Cocoapods)

```
pod install
```
